    "According to Wikipedia[3]; \"a particle is a small localized object of a substance to which can be ascribed several physical or chemical properties such as density, mass, volume\". In industry, when talking about particles, we can think about very small portions of solid substances, liquid droplets, gas bubbles with physical dimensions ranging from sub-nanometer to several millimeters in size[4]. The most common types of substances consisting of particles are[4]: \n",
    "1. Powders and granules e.g pigments in coatings, cement, dust e.t.c.\n",
    "2. Suspensions, emulsions and slurries e.g mining muds.\n",

    "Analysing particles of solid substances gives a better understanding of the physical properties associated with such substance. Properties such as flowability, dissolution rate, ease of agglomeration and dispersion in fluids, sedimentation velocity, abrasivity and compressibility e.t.c, can be controlled from an understanding of the size analysis of the solid sample[2]. Some of the most important pyhsical properties to measure include[4]:\n",
    "1. Particle size\n",
    "2. Particle shape \n",
    "3. Surface properties\n",
    "4. Charge properties (electrostatic interactions) \n",
    "5. Microstructure\n",
    "\n",
    "These importance of some or all of these properties will depend on the substance of interest. In the industry, particle properties are important to measure because they can help improve the quality of products for example in the food processing industry or help in improving processes, for example in the mining industry through particle size reduction. In particle properties measurement, the method of measurement is just as important as the results obtained as there are no existing unique values. Hence, the measured size distribution data for example, is method dependent[5]. According to Wiki[1], the way to best select the method to use in measurement is to ensure that the technique best suit the application it is intended for. For example, a sedimentation bed or a centrifugal system would normally use a sedimentation technique and where not possible, another technique may be used. This write up[6] points to a database of expert systems to help with the choice of technique."

    "Particles of substances can come in different shapes, for example, regular shapes such as spheres, cubes, tetrahedras e.t.c or can also be irregular. Perfect spheres can regular shapes such as cubes can have their sizes defined by one dimension such as radius or diameter. But, for some regular shapes like a cone, more than one dimensions must be specified[5]. The concept of \"equivalent spherical diameters\" can then be used to simplify the measurement process[4]. The equivalent spherical diameter is simply the diameter of that equivalent sphere that has the same property as the actual particle under consideration[4]. For example, a cube of 1 cm; its volume will be $1\\, cm^3$, the diameter of a sphere having thesame volume as the volume of the cube is $d_{v}$ and is given below[5]: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ V = \\dfrac{\\pi}{6}d_{v}^3  \\qquad and \\qquad d_{v}^3 = \\left(\\dfrac{6}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/3} = 1.241 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, the specific surface area, SSA of the cube $S = 6 \\,cm^2$. Thus, the diameter of a sphere having the same surface area as the cube $d_{s}$ is as follows[5]:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S = \\pi d_{s}^2 \\qquad and \\qquad d_{s} =  \\left(\\dfrac{6}{\\pi}\\right)^{1/2} = 1.382 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The surface to volume ratio can also be defined as it controls the rate at which particles interacts with the sorrounding[5]. This is given as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ S_{v} = \\dfrac{S}{V} = \\dfrac{\\pi d_{s}^2}{\\frac{\\pi}{6}d_{v}^3} = 6\\dfrac{d_{s}^2}{d_{v}^3} = \\dfrac{6}{d_{sv}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of equivalent sphere diameter is best applicable to regular shapes[4]. For irregular shapes such as needles or plates or rods where the size in one dimension can differ considerably from the size of the other dimensions, the concept of equivalent sphere diameter becomes increasingly difficult to apply.

This is because, the more coarse particles will absorb stronger intensities of light. Also, it is possible to convert from one distribution value to the other, but this require some assumptions to be made with respect to the form and physical properties associated with the sample[4]. For example, to convert from mass quantity distribution to volume, the density of the sample has to be uniform. "
