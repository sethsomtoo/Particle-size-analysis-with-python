# Particle size analysis with Python Jupyter notebook 
 
This project shows how python can be used to calculate a particles size distribution data. It shows how the histogram, cumulative distribution curve, and probability density curves can be plotted. Particle size measurements and calculating their distributions is a very important feature because they give insights to several pyhsical properties associated with the particle sample and this can help facilitate physical and chemical processes. This python script was created with jupyter notebook running on python 3 kernel. There are two jupyter notebooks in the folder. The first notebook contains some literature on particle size measurement techniques, data analysis and interpretation and was created with the jupyter markdown. The seccond notebook shows how the jupyter notebook can be used to calculate the particle size distribution functions with numpy and pandas and also how the distribution functions can be plotted using matplotlib.


# Important thing to note on the usage

When running the notebook (particle_size_analysis_literature) which contains the literature. Due to the images embedded in the notebook, it is important that the image files adjoined together with the notebook file be in the same directory for jupyter markdown to run successfully and display the images.
