# Particle size analysis with python
 
This project shows how python can be used to calculate a particles size distribution data. It shows how the histogram, cumulative distribution curve, and probability density curves can be plotted. Particle size measurements and calculating their distributions is a very important feature because they give insights to several pyhsical properties associated with the particle sample and this can help facilitate physical and chemical processes. This python script was created with jupyter notebook running on python 3 kernel. There are two jupyter notebooks in the folder. The first notebook contains some literature on particle size measurement techniques, data analysis and interpretation and was created with the jupyter markdown.
